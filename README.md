# rubberstamp: GitHub Action to fix GitHub Actions

# ABOUT

## Problem

In a shortsighted attempt to cut costs, GitHub disables recurring GitHub Actions for FOSS projects after a period of inactivity. Including important security scans. Which is backwards, because software vulnerabilities accrue most rapidly on old, stale projects. Every component downstream ends up inheriting the vulnerabilities.

This results in a default *insecure* state for the vast majority of GitHub repositories, including public FOSS and private projects.

Dependabot is not a complete answer, because Dependabot reports often omit vulnerabilities indicated by other SCA systems.

## Solution

We declare a recurring GitHub Action to update a nonce file in version control.

See [.github/workflows/rubberstamp.yml](.github/workflows/rubberstamp.yml).
